# Phishing Identification and Decision Support System

## Master Workforce Research Internship Summmer 2023

The Phishing Identification and Decision Support System (PIDSS) is a tool developed as part of the Master Workforce Internship 2023. This tool was made to help with identifying Phishing emails by properly scanning for commonly known strategies. This tool has an easy to understand Interface where users can see the ”Phishing Percentage” based on how likely the email provided is to be a Phishing attack. We hope to bring an easy to use and viable tool for users to detect, prevent and help identify these attacks.
